# Sound Structure Evaluation Network
This project contains the code used in my PhD thesis on multi-level constraint grammars.
Two chapters have been or are being published:

* van Leussen, J.W. & Escudero, P. (2015). Learning to perceive and recognize a second language: the L2LP model revised. Frontiers in psychology, 6, 1000.
* Boersma, P. & van Leussen, J.W. (2017) 	Efficient evaluation and learning in multi-level parallel constraint grammars (to appear in Linguistic Inquiry)

Currently the code is quite disorganised and messy. I plan to clean and refactor it a bit after handing in my manuscript, so that it can function as an online appendix of sorts to my thesis.
